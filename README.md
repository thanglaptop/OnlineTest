- In Challenge 1, I use the MVC structure to build the app. The model folder contains the models, the controller is MainActivity, and the views are in the res/layout folder.
- To build and run the app, first, you have to clone the project from GitHub. Then, open Challenge1 with Android Studio and run the app.
- The difficulty I encountered was that this was my first time using the Kotlin language, so mistakes were inevitable.
- As for the interface, I designed it to be as intuitive and smooth as possible. I hope you can review and provide feedback.
